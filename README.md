# Algorithmic-Trading-with-Python

In this repository, I create, test, implement & automate unique  trading strategies using python.

I combine simple and also more complex Technical Indicators and we will also create Machine Learning- and Deep Learning- powered Strategies.

Comprehensive and rigorous Backtesting / Forward Testing methods are used. The Vectorized Backtesting techniques, Iterative Backtesting techniques (event-driven), live Testing with play money, and more are applied.

Finally,  implement and automate your Trading Strategies with Python, powerful Broker APIs and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Create your own Trading Bot and fully automate/schedule your trading sessions in the AWS Cloud!
